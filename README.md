# PRODIGY_CS_01
TASK 1 :Implement Caesar Cipher

PROBLEM STATEMENT:  Create a Python program that can encrypt 
and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. 
Allow users to input a message and a shift value to 
perform encryption and decryption.

The one with app.py is GUI BASED and one with caesar_cipher.py is CLI BASED.

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet. The basic idea is to shift the letters of the message by a certain number (the "shift value") to transform the original message (plaintext) into encrypted text (ciphertext) and vice versa for decryption.


Caesar Cipher Overview:
Encryption: Shift each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions.
Decryption: Shift each letter of the ciphertext back by the same number of positions to recover the original message.
Shift Value: This is a number that determines how far to shift the letters. For example, a shift of 3 would transform A into D, B into E, and so on.
